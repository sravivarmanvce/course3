abstract: "Open scholarship is an umbrella term that refers to the endeavour to improve openness, integrity,
social justice, diversity, equity, inclusivity and accessibility in all areas of scholarly activities. Open scholarship extends the more widely used terms open science and open research to include academic fields beyond the sciences and activities beyond academic research."
